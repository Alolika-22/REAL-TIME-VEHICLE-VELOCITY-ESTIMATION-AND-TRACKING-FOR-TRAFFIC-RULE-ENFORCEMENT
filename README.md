# REAL-TIME-VEHICLE-VELOCITY-ESTIMATION-AND-TRACKING-FOR-TRAFFIC-RULE-ENFORCEMENT
This is done using YOLOv5 algorithm


   AIM: 
   
“ To detect and track fast moving vehicles in a real time traffic stream, and subsequently estimate its velocity.”
OBJECTIVE:

To transfer learn YOLO v5 DL model for image classification.

To tune the model for optimum performance.

Target : 95% > PREC, FPS >30.

To deploy the model in edge devices.
